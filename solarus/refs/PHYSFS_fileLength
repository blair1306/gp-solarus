 * \fn PHYSFS_sint64 PHYSFS_fileLength(PHYSFS_File *handle)
 * \brief Get total length of a file in bytes.
 *
 * Note that if the file size can&apos;t be determined (since the archive is
 *  &quot;streamed&quot; or whatnot) than this will report (-1). Also note that if
 *  another process/thread is writing to this file at the same time, then
 *  the information this function supplies could be incorrect before you
 *  get it. Use with caution, or better yet, don&apos;t use at all.
 *
 *   \param handle handle returned from PHYSFS_open*().
 *  \return size in bytes of the file. -1 if can&apos;t be determined.
