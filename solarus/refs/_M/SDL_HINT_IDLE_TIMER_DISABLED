 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether the idle timer is disabled on iOS.
 *
 *  When an iOS app does not receive touches for some time, the screen is
 *  dimmed automatically. For games where the accelerometer is the only input
 *  this is problematic. This functionality can be disabled by setting this
 *  hint.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - Enable idle timer
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - Disable idle timer
