 *  \brief Copy a portion of the source texture to the current rendering target, rotating it by angle around the given center
 *
 *  \param renderer The renderer which should copy parts of a texture.
 *  \param texture The source texture.
 *  \param srcrect   A pointer to the source rectangle, or NULL for the entire
 *                   texture.
 *  \param dstrect   A pointer to the destination rectangle, or NULL for the
 *                   entire rendering target.
 *  \param angle    An angle in degrees that indicates the rotation that will be applied to dstrect
 *  \param center   A pointer to a point indicating the point around which dstrect will be rotated (if NULL, rotation will be done aroud dstrect.w/2, dstrect.h/2)
 *  \param flip     An SDL_RendererFlip value stating which flipping actions should be performed on the texture
 *
 *  \return 0 on success, or -1 on error
