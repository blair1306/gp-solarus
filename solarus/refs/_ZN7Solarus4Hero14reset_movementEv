 * \brief Stops the movement of the player and lets the player restart it when he can.
 *
 * This function is typically called when the player temporarily loses the control
 * (e.g. because of a script or a map change) whereas the movement remains the same.
 * Then the movement may want to move a few pixels more as soon as it is resumed.
 * This function removes such residual effects of the player&apos;s movement.
 * If the current movement is not controlled by the player, this function has no effect.
