 *  \brief The generic template for any haptic effect.
 *
 *  All values max at 32767 (0x7FFF).  Signed values also can be negative.
 *  Time values unless specified otherwise are in milliseconds.
 *
 *  You can also pass ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY to length instead of a 0-32767
 *  value.  Neither delay, interval, attack_length nor fade_length support
 *  ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY.  Fade will also not be used since effect never ends.
 *
 *  Additionally, the ::SDL_HAPTIC_RAMP effect does not support a duration of
 *  ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY.
 *
 *  Button triggers may not be supported on all devices, it is advised to not
 *  use them if possible.  Buttons start at index 1 instead of index 0 like
 *  the joystick.
 *
 *  If both attack_length and fade_level are 0, the envelope is not used,
 *  otherwise both values are used.
 *
 *  Common parts:
 *  \code
 *  // Replay - All effects have this
 *  Uint32 length;        // Duration of effect (ms).
 *  Uint16 delay;         // Delay before starting effect.
 *
 *  // Trigger - All effects have this
 *  Uint16 button;        // Button that triggers effect.
 *  Uint16 interval;      // How soon before effect can be triggered again.
 *
 *  // Envelope - All effects except condition effects have this
 *  Uint16 attack_length; // Duration of the attack (ms).
 *  Uint16 attack_level;  // Level at the start of the attack.
 *  Uint16 fade_length;   // Duration of the fade out (ms).
 *  Uint16 fade_level;    // Level at the end of the fade.
 *  \endcode
 *
 *
 *  Here we have an example of a constant effect evolution in time:
