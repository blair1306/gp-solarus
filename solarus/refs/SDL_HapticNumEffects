 *  \brief Returns the number of effects a haptic device can store.

 *  On some platforms this isn&apos;t fully supported, and therefore is an
 *  approximation.  Always check to see if your created effect was actually
 *  created and do not rely solely on SDL_HapticNumEffects().

 *  \param haptic The haptic device to query effect max.
 *  \return The number of effects the haptic device can store or
