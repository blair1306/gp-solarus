 * \fn int PHYSFS_readSBE16(PHYSFS_File *file, PHYSFS_sint16 *val)
 * \brief Read and convert a signed 16-bit bigendian value.
 *
 * Convenience function. Read a signed 16-bit bigendian value from a
 *  file and convert it to the platform&apos;s native byte order.
 *
 *    \param file PhysicsFS file handle from which to read.
 *    \param val pointer to where value should be stored.
 *   \return zero on failure, non-zero on success. If successful, (*val) will
 *           store the result. On failure, you can find out what went wrong
 *           from PHYSFS_getLastError().
