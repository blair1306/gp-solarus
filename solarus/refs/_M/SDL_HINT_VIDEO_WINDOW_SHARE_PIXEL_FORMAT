*  \brief  A variable that is the address of another SDL_Window* (as a hex string formatted with &quot;%p&quot;).
*  
*  If this hint is set before SDL_CreateWindowFrom() and the SDL_Window* it is set to has
*  SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL set (and running on WGL only, currently), then two things will occur on the newly 
*  created SDL_Window:

*  1. Its pixel format will be set to the same pixel format as this SDL_Window.  This is
*  needed for example when sharing an OpenGL context across multiple windows.
*
*  2. The flag SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL will be set on the new window so it can be used for
*  OpenGL rendering.
*
*  This variable can be set to the following values:
*    The address (as a string &quot;%p&quot;) of the SDL_Window* that new windows created with SDL_CreateWindowFrom() should
*    share a pixel format with.
