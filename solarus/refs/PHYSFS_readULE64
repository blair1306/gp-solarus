 * \fn int PHYSFS_readULE64(PHYSFS_File *file, PHYSFS_uint64 *val)
 * \brief Read and convert an unsigned 64-bit littleendian value.
 *
 * Convenience function. Read an unsigned 64-bit littleendian value from a
 *  file and convert it to the platform&apos;s native byte order.
 *
 *    \param file PhysicsFS file handle from which to read.
 *    \param val pointer to where value should be stored.
 *   \return zero on failure, non-zero on success. If successful, (*val) will
 *           store the result. On failure, you can find out what went wrong
 *           from PHYSFS_getLastError().
 *
 * \warning Remember, PHYSFS_uint64 is only 32 bits on platforms without
 *          any sort of 64-bit support.
