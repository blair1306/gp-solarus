 *  \brief  A variable specifying which render driver to use.
 *
 *  If the application doesn&apos;t pick a specific renderer to use, this variable
 *  specifies the name of the preferred renderer.  If the preferred renderer
 *  can&apos;t be initialized, the normal default renderer is used.
 *
 *  This variable is case insensitive and can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;direct3d&quot;
 *    &quot;opengl&quot;
 *    &quot;opengles2&quot;
 *    &quot;opengles&quot;
 *    &quot;software&quot;
 *
 *  The default varies by platform, but it&apos;s the first one in the list that
 *  is available on the current platform.
