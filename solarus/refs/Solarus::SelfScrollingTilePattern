 * \brief Tile pattern that scrolls on itself when the camera moves.
 *
 * The pattern scolls on itself from 1 pixel when the camera moves from 2
 * pixels. This gives an illusion of depth.
 * It achieves the same effect as ParallaxScrollingTilePattern, but the tile
 * remains displayed at its initial position.
 * However, this is limited to simple, repeatable patterns:
 * you cannot make big scrolling backgrounds composed of different tiles
 * (use ParallaxScrollingTilePatterns for this) because the tile actually
 * does not move with the camera, it just scrolls on ifself.
