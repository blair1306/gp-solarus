 * \brief Ensures that a rectangle does not cross separators nor map bounds.
 * \param area The rectangle to check.
 * It is the responsibility of quest makers to put enough space between
 * separators (the space should be at least the quest size).
 * If separators are too close to each other for the rectangle to fit,
 * the camera will cross some of them.
 * If separators are too close to a limit of the map, the
 * the camera will cross them but will never cross map limits.
 * \return A rectangle corresponding to the first one but stopping on
 * separators and map bounds.
