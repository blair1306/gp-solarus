 *  \brief  A variable controlling how 3D acceleration is used to accelerate the SDL screen surface.
 *
 *  SDL can try to accelerate the SDL screen surface by using streaming
 *  textures with a 3D rendering engine.  This variable controls whether and
 *  how this is done.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - Disable 3D acceleration
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - Enable 3D acceleration, using the default renderer.
 *    &quot;X&quot;       - Enable 3D acceleration, using X where X is one of the valid rendering drivers.  (e.g. &quot;direct3d&quot;, &quot;opengl&quot;, etc.)
 *
 *  By default SDL tries to make a best guess for each platform whether
 *  to use acceleration or not.
