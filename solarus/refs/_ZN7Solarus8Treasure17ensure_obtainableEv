 * If the item is not allowed, the treasure becomes empty.
 * This function must be called before giving it to the player.
 *
 * This function is not called automatically because we want to decide to
 * remove the treasure (or not) as late as possible. The obtainable property
 * may indeed change after the creation of the treasure, for example if the
 * player finds a new equipment item in the meantime.
