 * \brief Flush a buffered PhysicsFS file handle.
 *
 * For buffered files opened for writing, this will put the current contents
 *  of the buffer to disk and flag the buffer as empty if possible.
 *
 * For buffered files opened for reading or unbuffered files, this is a safe
 *  no-op, and will report success.
 *
 *   \param handle handle returned from PHYSFS_open*().
 *  \return nonzero if successful, zero on error.
