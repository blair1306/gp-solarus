 *  \brief Set device independent resolution for rendering
 *
 *  \param renderer The renderer for which resolution should be set.
 *  \param w      The width of the logical resolution
 *  \param h      The height of the logical resolution
 *
 *  This function uses the viewport and scaling functionality to allow a fixed logical
 *  resolution for rendering, regardless of the actual output resolution.  If the actual
 *  output resolution doesn&apos;t have the same aspect ratio the output rendering will be
 *  centered within the output display.
 *
 *  If the output display is a window, mouse events in the window will be filtered
 *  and scaled so they seem to arrive within the logical resolution.
 *
 *  \note If this function results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the
 *        rendering backend, it will be handled using the appropriate
 *        quality hints.
