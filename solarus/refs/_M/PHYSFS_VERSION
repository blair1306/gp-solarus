 * \def PHYSFS_VERSION(x)
 * \brief Macro to determine PhysicsFS version program was compiled against.
 *
 * This macro fills in a PHYSFS_Version structure with the version of the
 *  library you compiled against. This is determined by what header the
 *  compiler uses. Note that if you dynamically linked the library, you might
 *  have a slightly newer or older version at runtime. That version can be
 *  determined with PHYSFS_getLinkedVersion(), which, unlike PHYSFS_VERSION,
 *  is not a macro.
 *
 * \param x A pointer to a PHYSFS_Version struct to initialize.
 *
 * \sa PHYSFS_Version
 * \sa PHYSFS_getLinkedVersion
