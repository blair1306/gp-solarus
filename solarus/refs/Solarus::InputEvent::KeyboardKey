     * Enumeration of keyboard keys.
     * This is a Solarus dedicated enumeration.
     * To make the SDL encapsulation easier, this enumeration is compatible
     * with the SDL_Keycode enumeration from SDL.
     * If you intend to replace SDL by another library one day, the API of the
     * Input class will not have to change
     * (only its implementation will).
     * The numeric values of the enumeration can be changed without breaking
     * savegames because savegames use a string name to store the commands.
