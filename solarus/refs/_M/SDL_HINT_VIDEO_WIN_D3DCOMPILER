*  \brief  A variable specifying which shader compiler to preload when using the Chrome ANGLE binaries
*
*  SDL has EGL and OpenGL ES2 support on Windows via the ANGLE project. It
*  can use two different sets of binaries, those compiled by the user from source
*  or those provided by the Chrome browser. In the later case, these binaries require
*  that SDL loads a DLL providing the shader compiler.
*
*  This variable can be set to the following values:
*    &quot;d3dcompiler_46.dll&quot; - default, best for Vista or later.
*    &quot;d3dcompiler_43.dll&quot; - for XP support.
*    &quot;none&quot; - do not load any library, useful if you compiled ANGLE from source and included the compiler in your binaries.
