 *  Create a thread.
 *
 *   Thread naming is a little complicated: Most systems have very small
 *    limits for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16,
 *    Visual C++ 6.0 has nine!), and possibly other arbitrary rules. You&apos;ll
 *    have to see what happens with your system&apos;s debugger. The name should be
 *    UTF-8 (but using the naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet).
 *   There are no requirements for thread naming conventions, so long as the
 *    string is null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in
 *    choosing a name:

 *
 *   If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for
 *    it (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available
 *    from SDL_GetThreadName().
