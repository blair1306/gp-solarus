 * \fn PHYSFS_File *PHYSFS_openRead(const char *filename)
 * \brief Open a file for reading.
 *
 * Open a file for reading, in platform-independent notation. The search path
 *  is checked one at a time until a matching file is found, in which case an
 *  abstract filehandle is associated with it, and reading may be done.
 *  The reading offset is set to the first byte of the file.
 *
 * Note that entries that are symlinks are ignored if
 *  PHYSFS_permitSymbolicLinks(1) hasn&apos;t been called, and opening a
 *  symlink with this function will fail in such a case.
 *
 *   \param filename File to open.
 *  \return A valid PhysicsFS filehandle on success, NULL on error. Specifics
 *           of the error can be gleaned from PHYSFS_getLastError().
