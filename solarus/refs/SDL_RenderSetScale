 *  \brief Set the drawing scale for rendering on the current target.
 *
 *  \param renderer The renderer for which the drawing scale should be set.
 *  \param scaleX The horizontal scaling factor
 *  \param scaleY The vertical scaling factor
 *
 *  The drawing coordinates are scaled by the x/y scaling factors
 *  before they are used by the renderer.  This allows resolution
 *  independent drawing with a single coordinate system.
 *
 *  \note If this results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the
 *        rendering backend, it will be handled using the appropriate
 *        quality hints.  For best results use integer scaling factors.
