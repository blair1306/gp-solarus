 *  \brief Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.
 *
 *  If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the
 *  current version will be different than the version you compiled against.
 *  This function returns the current version, while SDL_VERSION() is a
 *  macro that tells you what version you compiled with.
 *
 *  \code
 *  SDL_version compiled;
 *  SDL_version linked;
 *
 *  SDL_VERSION(&amp;compiled);
 *  SDL_GetVersion(&amp;linked);
 *  printf(&quot;We compiled against SDL version %d.%d.%d ...\n&quot;,
 *         compiled.major, compiled.minor, compiled.patch);
 *  printf(&quot;But we linked against SDL version %d.%d.%d.\n&quot;,
 *         linked.major, linked.minor, linked.patch);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  This function may be called safely at any time, even before SDL_Init().
 *
 *  \sa SDL_VERSION
