 * \fn void PHYSFS_utf8FromUcs4(const PHYSFS_uint32 *src, char *dst, PHYSFS_uint64 len)
 * \brief Convert a UCS-4 string to a UTF-8 string.
 *
 * UCS-4 strings are 32-bits per character: \c wchar_t on Unix.
 *
 * To ensure that the destination buffer is large enough for the conversion,
 *  please allocate a buffer that is the same size as the source buffer. UTF-8
 *  never uses more than 32-bits per character, so while it may shrink a UCS-4
 *  string, it will never expand it.
 *
 * Strings that don&apos;t fit in the destination buffer will be truncated, but
 *  will always be null-terminated and never have an incomplete UTF-8
 *  sequence at the end. If the buffer length is 0, this function does nothing.
 *
 *   \param src Null-terminated source string in UCS-4 format.
 *   \param dst Buffer to store converted UTF-8 string.
 *   \param len Size, in bytes, of destination buffer.
