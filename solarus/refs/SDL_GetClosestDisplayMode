 *  \brief Get the closest match to the requested display mode.
 *
 *  \param displayIndex The index of display from which mode should be queried.
 *  \param mode The desired display mode
 *  \param closest A pointer to a display mode to be filled in with the closest
 *                 match of the available display modes.
 *
 *  \return The passed in value \c closest, or NULL if no matching video mode
 *          was available.
 *
 *  The available display modes are scanned, and \c closest is filled in with the
 *  closest mode matching the requested mode and returned.  The mode format and
 *  refresh_rate default to the desktop mode if they are 0.  The modes are
 *  scanned with size being first priority, format being second priority, and
 *  finally checking the refresh_rate.  If all the available modes are too
 *  small, then NULL is returned.
