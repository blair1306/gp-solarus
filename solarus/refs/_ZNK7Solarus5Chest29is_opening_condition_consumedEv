 * \brief Returns whether opening this chest consumes the condition that
 * was required.
 *
 * If this setting is \c true, here is the behavior when the hero opens
 * the chest:
 * - If the opening method is OPENING_BY_INTERACTION_IF_SAVEGAME_VARIABLE,
 *   then the required savegame variable is either:
 *   - set to \c false if it is a boolean,
 *   - decremented if it is an integer,
 *   - set to an empty string if it is a string.
 * - If the opening method is OPENING_BY_INTERACTION_IF_ITEM, then:
 *   - if the required item has an amount, the amount is decremented.
 *   - if the required item has no amount, its possession state is set to zero.
 * - With other opening methods, this setting has no effect.
 *
 * \return \c true if opening this chest consumes the condition that was
 * required.
