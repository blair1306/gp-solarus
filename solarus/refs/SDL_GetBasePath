 * \brief Get the path where the application resides.
 *
 * Get the &quot;base path&quot;. This is the directory where the application was run
 *  from, which is probably the installation directory, and may or may not
 *  be the process&apos;s current working directory.
 *
 * This returns an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding, and is guaranteed to
 *  end with a path separator (&apos;\\&apos; on Windows, &apos;/&apos; most other places).
 *
 * The pointer returned by this function is owned by you. Please call
 *  SDL_free() on the pointer when you are done with it, or it will be a
 *  memory leak. This is not necessarily a fast call, though, so you should
 *  call this once near startup and save the string if you need it.
 *
 * Some platforms can&apos;t determine the application&apos;s path, and on other
 *  platforms, this might be meaningless. In such cases, this function will
 *  return NULL.
 *
 *  \return String of base dir in UTF-8 encoding, or NULL on error.
