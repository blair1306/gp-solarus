 *  \brief Get the size of a window&apos;s underlying drawable (for use with glViewport).
 *
 *  \param window   Window from which the drawable size should be queried
 *  \param w        Pointer to variable for storing the width, may be NULL
 *  \param h        Pointer to variable for storing the height, may be NULL
 *
 * This may differ from SDL_GetWindowSize if we&apos;re rendering to a high-DPI
 * drawable, i.e. the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a
 * platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this &quot;Retina&quot;), and not disabled
 * by the SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED hint.
