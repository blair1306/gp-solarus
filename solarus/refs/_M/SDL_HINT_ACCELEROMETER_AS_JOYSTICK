 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether an Android built-in accelerometer should be
 *  listed as a joystick device, rather than listing actual joysticks only.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - List only real joysticks and accept input from them
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - List real joysticks along with the accelerometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick (the default).
