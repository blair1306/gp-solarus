 * \typedef PHYSFS_StringCallback
 * \brief Function signature for callbacks that report strings.
 *
 * These are used to report a list of strings to an original caller, one
 *  string per callback. All strings are UTF-8 encoded. Functions should not
 *  try to modify or free the string&apos;s memory.
 *
 * These callbacks are used, starting in PhysicsFS 1.1, as an alternative to
 *  functions that would return lists that need to be cleaned up with
 *  PHYSFS_freeList(). The callback means that the library doesn&apos;t need to
 *  allocate an entire list and all the strings up front.
 *
 * Be aware that promises data ordering in the list versions are not
 *  necessarily so in the callback versions. Check the documentation on
 *  specific APIs, but strings may not be sorted as you expect.
 *
 *    \param data User-defined data pointer, passed through from the API
 *                that eventually called the callback.
 *    \param str The string data about which the callback is meant to inform.
