 * \fn void PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs4(const char *src, PHYSFS_uint32 *dst, PHYSFS_uint64 len)
 * \brief Convert a UTF-8 string to a UCS-4 string.
 *
 * UCS-4 strings are 32-bits per character: \c wchar_t on Unix.
 *
 * To ensure that the destination buffer is large enough for the conversion,
 *  please allocate a buffer that is four times the size of the source buffer.
 *  UTF-8 uses from one to four bytes per character, but UCS-4 always uses
 *  four, so an entirely low-ASCII string will quadruple in size!
 *
 * Strings that don&apos;t fit in the destination buffer will be truncated, but
 *  will always be null-terminated and never have an incomplete UCS-4
 *  sequence at the end. If the buffer length is 0, this function does nothing.
 *
 *   \param src Null-terminated source string in UTF-8 format.
 *   \param dst Buffer to store converted UCS-4 string.
 *   \param len Size, in bytes, of destination buffer.
