 * \brief Returns whether a rectangle overlaps the active region of the jumper.
 *
 * For a horizontal or vertical jumper, the active region is the whole
 * bounding box, that is, an 8-pixel thick horizontal or vertical strip.
 * For a diagonal jumper, the active region is an 8-pixel thick diagonal strip.
 *
 * \param rectangle A rectangle.
 * \param extended_region Whether you want to consider the extended jumper
 * beyond its bounding box, or to keep it restricted to its bounding box.
 * \return \c true if the rectangle overlaps the active region of the jumper.
