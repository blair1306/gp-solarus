 * Distance attenuation model.
 * Type:    ALint
 * Range:   [AL_NONE, AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE, AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED,
 *           AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE, AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE_CLAMPED,
 *           AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE, AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE_CLAMPED]
 * Default: AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED
 *
 * The model by which sources attenuate with distance.
 *
 * None     - No distance attenuation.
 * Inverse  - Doubling the distance halves the source gain.
 * Linear   - Linear gain scaling between the reference and max distances.
 * Exponent - Exponential gain dropoff.
 *
 * Clamped variations work like the non-clamped counterparts, except the
 * distance calculated is clamped between the reference and max distances.
