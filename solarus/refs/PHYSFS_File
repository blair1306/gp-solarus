 * \struct PHYSFS_File
 * \brief A PhysicsFS file handle.
 *
 * You get a pointer to one of these when you open a file for reading,
 *  writing, or appending via PhysicsFS.
 *
 * As you can see from the lack of meaningful fields, you should treat this
 *  as opaque data. Don&apos;t try to manipulate the file handle, just pass the
 *  pointer you got, unmolested, to various PhysicsFS APIs.
