 * \brief Returns whether this entity is drawn at its position on the map.
 *
 * Usually, this function returns true, and when it is the case, draw_on_map()
 * is called only for entities located in the camera&apos;s rectangle.
 *
 * However, some entities may want to be drawn in the camera even when their
 * position is outside, typically to make an illusion of movement like parallax
 * scrolling.
 *
 * \return true if this entity is drawn where it is located.
