 * \fn const char *PHYSFS_getDirSeparator(void)
 * \brief Get platform-dependent dir separator string.
 *
 * This returns &quot;\\&quot; on win32, &quot;/&quot; on Unix, and &quot;:&quot; on MacOS. It may be more
 *  than one character, depending on the platform, and your code should take
 *  that into account. Note that this is only useful for setting up the
 *  search/write paths, since access into those dirs always use &apos;/&apos;
 *  (platform-independent notation) to separate directories. This is also
 *  handy for getting platform-independent access when using stdio calls.
 *
 *   \return READ ONLY null-terminated string of platform&apos;s dir separator.
