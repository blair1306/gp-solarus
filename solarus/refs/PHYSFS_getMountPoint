 * \fn int PHYSFS_getMountPoint(const char *dir)
 * \brief Determine a mounted archive&apos;s mountpoint.
 *
 * You give this function the name of an archive or dir you successfully
 *  added to the search path, and it reports the location in the interpolated
 *  tree where it is mounted. Files mounted with a NULL mountpoint or through
 *  PHYSFS_addToSearchPath() will report &quot;/&quot;. The return value is READ ONLY
 *  and valid until the archive is removed from the search path.
 *
 *   \param dir directory or archive previously added to the path, in
 *              platform-dependent notation. This must match the string
 *              used when adding, even if your string would also reference
 *              the same file with a different string of characters.
 *  \return READ-ONLY string of mount point if added to path, NULL on failure
 *          (bogus archive, etc) Specifics of the error can be gleaned from
 *          PHYSFS_getLastError().
