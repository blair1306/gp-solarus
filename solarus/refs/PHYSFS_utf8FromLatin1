 * \fn void PHYSFS_utf8FromLatin1(const char *src, char *dst, PHYSFS_uint64 len)
 * \brief Convert a UTF-8 string to a Latin1 string.
 *
 * Latin1 strings are 8-bits per character: a popular &quot;high ASCII&quot;
 *  encoding.
 *
 * To ensure that the destination buffer is large enough for the conversion,
 *  please allocate a buffer that is double the size of the source buffer.
 *  UTF-8 expands latin1 codepoints over 127 from 1 to 2 bytes, so the string
 *  may grow in some cases.
 *
 * Strings that don&apos;t fit in the destination buffer will be truncated, but
 *  will always be null-terminated and never have an incomplete UTF-8
 *  sequence at the end. If the buffer length is 0, this function does nothing.
 *
 * Please note that we do not supply a UTF-8 to Latin1 converter, since Latin1
 *  can&apos;t express most Unicode codepoints. It&apos;s a legacy encoding; you should
 *  be converting away from it at all times.
 *
 *   \param src Null-terminated source string in Latin1 format.
 *   \param dst Buffer to store converted UTF-8 string.
 *   \param len Size, in bytes, of destination buffer.
