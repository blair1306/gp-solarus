<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_audio.h' l='300'>/**
 *  Get the number of available devices exposed by the current driver.
 *  Only valid after a successfully initializing the audio subsystem.
 *  Returns -1 if an explicit list of devices can&apos;t be determined; this is
 *  not an error. For example, if SDL is set up to talk to a remote audio
 *  server, it can&apos;t list every one available on the Internet, but it will
 *  still allow a specific host to be specified to SDL_OpenAudioDevice().
 *
 *  In many common cases, when this function returns a value &lt;= 0, it can still
 *  successfully open the default device (NULL for first argument of
 *  SDL_OpenAudioDevice()).
