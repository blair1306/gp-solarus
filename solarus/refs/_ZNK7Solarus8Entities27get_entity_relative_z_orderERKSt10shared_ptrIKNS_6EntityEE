 * \brief Returns a hint on the Z order of this entity.
 *
 * It can be used to know if an entity is above or below another one on the
 * same layer. It is unique for each entity on the same layer.
 *
 * This is an arbitrary value: it is not necessarily between 0 and the number
 * of entities on the layer. Its value only makes sense when compared to the
 * value of other entities.
 * Due to entities being removed from the map, entities whose layer changes,
 * and bring_to_front()/bring_to_back() calls,
 * there may be holes in the sequence.
 * The returned value can even be negative.
 *
 * \param entity An entity of the map.
 * \return Its relative Z order.
