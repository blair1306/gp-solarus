<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_audio.h' l='331'>/**
 *  Open a specific audio device. Passing in a device name of NULL requests
 *  the most reasonable default (and is equivalent to calling SDL_OpenAudio()).
 *
 *  The device name is a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName(), but
 *  some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a
 *  hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the
 *  diskaudio driver.
 *
 *  \return 0 on error, a valid device ID that is &gt;= 2 on success.
 *
 *  SDL_OpenAudio(), unlike this function, always acts on device ID 1.
