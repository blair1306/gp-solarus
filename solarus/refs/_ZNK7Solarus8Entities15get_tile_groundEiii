 * \brief Returns the ground property of tiles at the specified point.
 *
 * Only static tiles are considered here (not the dynamic entities).
 * Use get_ground() instead to also take into account dynamic entities that
 * may change the ground, like dynamic tiles and destructible entities.
 *
 * This function assumes that the parameters are correct: for performance
 * reasons, no check is done here.
 *
 * \param layer Layer of the point.
 * \param x X coordinate of the point.
 * \param y Y coordinate of the point.
 * \return The ground of the highest tile at this place.
