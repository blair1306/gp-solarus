 * \brief Tests whether the hero is cutting with his sword the specified entity
 * for which a collision was detected.
 *
 * When the sword sprite collides with an entity,
 * this function can be called to determine whether the hero is
 * really cutting this particular entity precisely.
 * This depends on the hero&apos;s state, his direction and his
 * distance to the detector.
 * This function assumes that there is already a collision
 * between the sword sprite and the detector&apos;s sprite.
 * This function should be called to check whether the
 * hero wants to cut a bush or some grass.
 * Returns false by default.
 *
 * \param entity The entity to check.
 * \return \c true if the sword is cutting this entity.
