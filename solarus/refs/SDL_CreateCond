 *  Create a condition variable.
 *
 *  Typical use of condition variables:
 *
 *  Thread A:
 *    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
 *    while ( ! condition ) {
 *        SDL_CondWait(cond, lock);
 *    }
 *    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);
 *
 *  Thread B:
 *    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
 *    ...
 *    condition = true;
 *    ...
 *    SDL_CondSignal(cond);
 *    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);
 *
 *  There is some discussion whether to signal the condition variable
 *  with the mutex locked or not.  There is some potential performance
 *  benefit to unlocking first on some platforms, but there are some
 *  potential race conditions depending on how your code is structured.
 *
 *  In general it&apos;s safer to signal the condition variable while the
 *  mutex is locked.
