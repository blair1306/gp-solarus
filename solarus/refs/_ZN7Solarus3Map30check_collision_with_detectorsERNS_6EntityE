 * \brief Checks the collisions between an entity and the detectors of the map.
 *
 * This function is called by an entity sensitive to the entity detectors
 * when this entity has just moved on the map, or when a detector
 * wants to check this entity.
 * We check whether or not the entity overlaps an entity detector.
 * If the map is suspended, this function does nothing.
 *
 * \param entity The entity that has just moved (this entity should have
 * a movement sensible to the collisions).
