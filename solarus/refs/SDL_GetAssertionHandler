 *  \brief Get the current assertion handler.
 *
 *  This returns the function pointer that is called when an assertion is
 *   triggered. This is either the value last passed to
 *   SDL_SetAssertionHandler(), or if no application-specified function is
 *   set, is equivalent to calling SDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler().
 *
 *   \param puserdata Pointer to a void*, which will store the &quot;userdata&quot;
 *                    pointer that was passed to SDL_SetAssertionHandler().
 *                    This value will always be NULL for the default handler.
 *                    If you don&apos;t care about this data, it is safe to pass
 *                    a NULL pointer to this function to ignore it.
 *  \return The SDL_AssertionHandler that is called when an assert triggers.
