 *  \brief Opens a Haptic device for usage from a Joystick device.
 *
 *  You must still close the haptic device seperately.  It will not be closed
 *  with the joystick.
 *
 *  When opening from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before
 *  closing the joystick device.  If not, on some implementations the haptic
 *  device will also get unallocated and you&apos;ll be unable to use force feedback
 *  on that device.
 *
 *  \param joystick Joystick to create a haptic device from.
 *  \return A valid haptic device identifier on success or NULL on error.
