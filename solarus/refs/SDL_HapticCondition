 *  \brief A structure containing a template for a Condition effect.
 *
 *  The struct handles the following effects:
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING: Effect based on axes position.
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER: Effect based on axes velocity.
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA: Effect based on axes acceleration.
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION: Effect based on axes movement.
 *
 *  Direction is handled by condition internals instead of a direction member.
 *  The condition effect specific members have three parameters.  The first
 *  refers to the X axis, the second refers to the Y axis and the third
 *  refers to the Z axis.  The right terms refer to the positive side of the
 *  axis and the left terms refer to the negative side of the axis.  Please
 *  refer to the ::SDL_HapticDirection diagram for which side is positive and
 *  which is negative.
