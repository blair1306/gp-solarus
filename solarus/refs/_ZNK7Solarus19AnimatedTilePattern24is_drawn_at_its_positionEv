 * \brief Returns whether tiles having this tile pattern are drawn at their
 * position.
 *
 * Usually, this function returns true, and when it is the case, draw() is
 * called only for tiles that are located in the current viewport.
 *
 * However, some tile patterns may want to be drawn even when they are not
 * in the viewport, typically to make an illusion of movement like parallax
 * scrolling.
