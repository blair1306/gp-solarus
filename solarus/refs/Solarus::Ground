 * \brief The possible kinds of grounds on a map.
 *
 * The ground of a point of the map is the one of the tile, dynamic tile
 * or destructible entity placed there.
 * If several entities are present at that point (like a traversable dynamic
 * tile over a hole tile),
 * the highest one whose ground is not GROUND_EMPTY wins.
