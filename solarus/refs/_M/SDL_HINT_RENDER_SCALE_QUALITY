 *  \brief  A variable controlling the scaling quality
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot; or &quot;nearest&quot; - Nearest pixel sampling
 *    &quot;1&quot; or &quot;linear&quot;  - Linear filtering (supported by OpenGL and Direct3D)
 *    &quot;2&quot; or &quot;best&quot;    - Currently this is the same as &quot;linear&quot;
 *
 *  By default nearest pixel sampling is used
