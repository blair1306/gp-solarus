 * \fn const char *PHYSFS_getUserDir(void)
 * \brief Get the path where user&apos;s home directory resides.
 *
 * Helper function.
 *
 * Get the &quot;user dir&quot;. This is meant to be a suggestion of where a specific
 *  user of the system can store files. On Unix, this is her home directory.
 *  On systems with no concept of multiple home directories (MacOS, win95),
 *  this will default to something like &quot;C:\mybasedir\users\username&quot;
 *  where &quot;username&quot; will either be the login name, or &quot;default&quot; if the
 *  platform doesn&apos;t support multiple users, either.
 *
 * You should probably use the user dir as the basis for your write dir, and
 *  also put it near the beginning of your search path.
 *
 *  \return READ ONLY string of user dir in platform-dependent notation.
