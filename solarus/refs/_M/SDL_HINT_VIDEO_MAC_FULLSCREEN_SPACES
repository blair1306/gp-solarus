 *  \brief  A variable that dictates policy for fullscreen Spaces on Mac OS X.
 *
 *  This hint only applies to Mac OS X.
 *
 *  The variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - Disable Spaces support (FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP won&apos;t use them and
 *                SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE windows won&apos;t offer the &quot;fullscreen&quot;
 *                button on their titlebars).
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - Enable Spaces support (FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP will use them and
 *                SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE windows will offer the &quot;fullscreen&quot;
 *                button on their titlebars.
 *
 *  The default value is &quot;1&quot;. Spaces are disabled regardless of this hint if
 *   the OS isn&apos;t at least Mac OS X Lion (10.7). This hint must be set before
 *   any windows are created.
