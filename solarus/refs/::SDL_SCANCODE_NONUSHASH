                                  *   instead of 49 for the same key, but all
                                  *   OSes I&apos;ve seen treat the two codes
                                  *   identically. So, as an implementor, unless
                                  *   your keyboard generates both of those
                                  *   codes and your OS treats them differently,
                                  *   you should generate SDL_SCANCODE_BACKSLASH
                                  *   instead of this code. As a user, you
                                  *   should not rely on this code because SDL
                                  *   will never generate it with most (all?)
                                  *   keyboards.
