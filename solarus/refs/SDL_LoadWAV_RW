<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_audio.h' l='390'>/**
 *  This function loads a WAVE from the data source, automatically freeing
 *  that source if \c freesrc is non-zero.  For example, to load a WAVE file,
 *  you could do:
 *  \code
 *      SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWFromFile(&quot;sample.wav&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;), 1, ...);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  If this function succeeds, it returns the given SDL_AudioSpec,
 *  filled with the audio data format of the wave data, and sets
 *  \c *audio_buf to a malloc()&apos;d buffer containing the audio data,
 *  and sets \c *audio_len to the length of that audio buffer, in bytes.
 *  You need to free the audio buffer with SDL_FreeWAV() when you are
 *  done with it.
 *
 *  This function returns NULL and sets the SDL error message if the
 *  wave file cannot be opened, uses an unknown data format, or is
 *  corrupt.  Currently raw and MS-ADPCM WAVE files are supported.
