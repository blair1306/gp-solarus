 * \brief Stores the tree of what surfaces have to be drawn on other surfaces.
 *
 * When a drawing is requested, if the destination surface is in GPU, no
 * drawing actually occurs: instead, the information is stored into this tree.
 * At rendering time, the tree is traversed to perform all drawings
 * accelerated in GPU.
 *
 * The root node of the tree is the screen, and the children nodes are the
 * surfaces drawn on it.
 *
 * Each node represents a source surface drawn somewhere, and the list of
 * surfaces drawn on itself.
