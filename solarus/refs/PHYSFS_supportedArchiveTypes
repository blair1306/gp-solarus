 * \fn const PHYSFS_ArchiveInfo **PHYSFS_supportedArchiveTypes(void)
 * \brief Get a list of supported archive types.
 *
 * Get a list of archive types supported by this implementation of PhysicFS.
 *  These are the file formats usable for search path entries. This is for
 *  informational purposes only. Note that the extension listed is merely
 *  convention: if we list &quot;ZIP&quot;, you can open a PkZip-compatible archive
 *  with an extension of &quot;XYZ&quot;, if you like.
 *
 * The returned value is an array of pointers to PHYSFS_ArchiveInfo structures,
 *  with a NULL entry to signify the end of the list:
 *
 * \code
 * PHYSFS_ArchiveInfo **i;
 *
 * for (i = PHYSFS_supportedArchiveTypes(); *i != NULL; i++)
 * {
 *     printf(&quot;Supported archive: [%s], which is [%s].\n&quot;,
 *              (*i)-&gt;extension, (*i)-&gt;description);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The return values are pointers to static internal memory, and should
 *  be considered READ ONLY, and never freed.
 *
 *   \return READ ONLY Null-terminated array of READ ONLY structures.
