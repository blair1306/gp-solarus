 * \fn PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs2(const char *src, PHYSFS_uint16 *dst, PHYSFS_uint64 len)
 * \brief Convert a UTF-8 string to a UCS-2 string.
 *
 * UCS-2 strings are 16-bits per character: \c TCHAR on Windows, when building
 *  with Unicode support.
 *
 * To ensure that the destination buffer is large enough for the conversion,
 *  please allocate a buffer that is double the size of the source buffer.
 *  UTF-8 uses from one to four bytes per character, but UCS-2 always uses
 *  two, so an entirely low-ASCII string will double in size!
 *
 * Strings that don&apos;t fit in the destination buffer will be truncated, but
 *  will always be null-terminated and never have an incomplete UCS-2
 *  sequence at the end. If the buffer length is 0, this function does nothing.
 *
 * Please note that UCS-2 is not UTF-16; we do not support the &quot;surrogate&quot;
 *  values at this time.
 *
 *   \param src Null-terminated source string in UTF-8 format.
 *   \param dst Buffer to store converted UCS-2 string.
 *   \param len Size, in bytes, of destination buffer.
