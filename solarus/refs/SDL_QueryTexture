 *  \param texture A texture to be queried.
 *  \param format  A pointer filled in with the raw format of the texture.  The
 *                 actual format may differ, but pixel transfers will use this
 *                 format.
 *  \param access  A pointer filled in with the actual access to the texture.
 *  \param w       A pointer filled in with the width of the texture in pixels.
 *  \param h       A pointer filled in with the height of the texture in pixels.
 *
 *  \return 0 on success, or -1 if the texture is not valid.
