 *  \brief Structure that represents a haptic direction.
 *
 *  Directions can be specified by:
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR : Specified by polar coordinates.
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN : Specified by cartesian coordinates.
 *   - ::SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL : Specified by spherical coordinates.
 *
 *  Cardinal directions of the haptic device are relative to the positioning
 *  of the device.  North is considered to be away from the user.
 *
 *  The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:

 *
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a
 *  degree starting north and turning clockwise.  ::SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses
 *  the first \c dir parameter.  The cardinal directions would be:
 *   - North: 0 (0 degrees)
 *   - East: 9000 (90 degrees)
 *   - South: 18000 (180 degrees)
 *   - West: 27000 (270 degrees)
 *
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions
 *  (X axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)).  ::SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses
 *  the first three \c dir parameters.  The cardinal directions would be:
 *   - North:  0,-1, 0
 *   - East:  -1, 0, 0
 *   - South:  0, 1, 0
 *   - West:   1, 0, 0
 *
 *  The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise
 *  it&apos;s unused.  In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you
 *  can use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.
 *
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations.
 *  The first two \c dir parameters are used.  The \c dir parameters are as
 *  follows (all values are in hundredths of degrees):
 *   - Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1).
 *   - Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes).
 *
 *
 *  Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming
 *  from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):
 *  \code
 *  SDL_HapticDirection direction;
 *
 *  // Cartesian directions
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding.
 *  direction.dir[0] = 0; // X position
 *  direction.dir[1] = 1; // Y position
 *  // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don&apos;t need to specify third parameter.
 *
 *  // Polar directions
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We&apos;ll be using polar direction encoding.
 *  direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter
 *
 *  // Spherical coordinates
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding
 *  direction.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don&apos;t need more parameters.
 *  \endcode
