 * \typedef PHYSFS_EnumFilesCallback
 * \brief Function signature for callbacks that enumerate files.
 *
 * These are used to report a list of directory entries to an original caller,
 *  one file/dir/symlink per callback. All strings are UTF-8 encoded.
 *  Functions should not try to modify or free any string&apos;s memory.
 *
 * These callbacks are used, starting in PhysicsFS 1.1, as an alternative to
 *  functions that would return lists that need to be cleaned up with
 *  PHYSFS_freeList(). The callback means that the library doesn&apos;t need to
 *  allocate an entire list and all the strings up front.
 *
 * Be aware that promises data ordering in the list versions are not
 *  necessarily so in the callback versions. Check the documentation on
 *  specific APIs, but strings may not be sorted as you expect.
 *
 *    \param data User-defined data pointer, passed through from the API
 *                that eventually called the callback.
 *    \param origdir A string containing the full path, in platform-independent
 *                   notation, of the directory containing this file. In most
 *                   cases, this is the directory on which you requested
 *                   enumeration, passed in the callback for your convenience.
 *    \param fname The filename that is being enumerated. It may not be in
 *                 alphabetical order compared to other callbacks that have
 *                 fired, and it will not contain the full path. You can
 *                 recreate the fullpath with $origdir/$fname ... The file
 *                 can be a subdirectory, a file, a symlink, etc.
