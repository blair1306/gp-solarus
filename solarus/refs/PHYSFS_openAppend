 * \fn PHYSFS_File *PHYSFS_openAppend(const char *filename)
 * \brief Open a file for appending.
 *
 * Open a file for writing, in platform-independent notation and in relation
 *  to the write dir as the root of the writable filesystem. The specified
 *  file is created if it doesn&apos;t exist. If it does exist, the writing offset
 *  is set to the end of the file, so the first write will be the byte after
 *  the end.
 *
 * Note that entries that are symlinks are ignored if
 *  PHYSFS_permitSymbolicLinks(1) hasn&apos;t been called, and opening a
 *  symlink with this function will fail in such a case.
 *
 *   \param filename File to open.
 *  \return A valid PhysicsFS filehandle on success, NULL on error. Specifics
 *           of the error can be gleaned from PHYSFS_getLastError().
