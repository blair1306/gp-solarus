 *  \brief Updates the properties of an effect.

 *  Can be used dynamically, although behaviour when dynamically changing
 *  direction may be strange.  Specifically the effect may reupload itself
 *  and start playing from the start.  You cannot change the type either when
 *  running SDL_HapticUpdateEffect().
 *
 *  \param haptic Haptic device that has the effect.
 *  \param effect Effect to update.
 *  \param data New effect properties to use.
 *  \return 0 on success or -1 on error.
