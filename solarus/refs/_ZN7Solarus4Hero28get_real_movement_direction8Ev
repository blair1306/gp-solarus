 * \brief Returns the actual direction of the hero&apos;s movement.
 *
 * This function returns the actual direction of the hero&apos;s movement, which can be different from the one
 * defined by the directional keys pressed by the player because we consider obstacles here.
 * If he does not want to move, -1 is returned. If he is trying to move but cannot because of obstacles,
 * the direction he is trying to move toward is returned.
 * This function is not used to compute the hero&apos;s movement (PlayerMovement does that) but only
 * to decide what direction to give to its sprites once the movement is already computed.
 *
 * \return the hero&apos;s actual direction between 0 and 7, or -1 if he is stopped
