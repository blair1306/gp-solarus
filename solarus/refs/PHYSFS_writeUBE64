 * \fn int PHYSFS_writeUBE64(PHYSFS_File *file, PHYSFS_uint64 val)
 * \brief Convert and write an unsigned 64-bit bigendian value.
 *
 * Convenience function. Convert an unsigned 64-bit value from the platform&apos;s
 *  native byte order to bigendian and write it to a file.
 *
 *    \param file PhysicsFS file handle to which to write.
 *    \param val Value to convert and write.
 *   \return zero on failure, non-zero on success. On failure, you can
 *           find out what went wrong from PHYSFS_getLastError().
 *
 * \warning Remember, PHYSFS_uint64 is only 32 bits on platforms without
 *          any sort of 64-bit support.
