 * \brief Returns the modified ground of an entity at the specified point.
 *
 * The point is assumed to overlap the entity.
 *
 * The point only matters if the ground is diagonal.
 * When an entity has a diagonal ground, only 8x8 squares on the diagonal of
 * that entity are diagonal grounds, other ones are resolved Ground::WALL on a
 * side and Ground::TRAVERSABLE or Ground::DEEP_WATER on the other side.
 *
 * A current limitation is that entities with diagonal grounds must be aligned
 * to the 8x8 grid to work correctly.
 *
 * \param entity Entity whose modified ground to get.
 * \param x X coordinate of the point.
 * \param y Y coordinate of the point.
 * \return The ground at this place.
