 * \brief Tile pattern with a parallax scrolling effect.
 *
 * The pattern moves from 1 pixel when the camera moves from 2 pixels.
 * This gives an illusion of depth. Only the position of where the pattern
 * is displayed changes: the real position of the tile never changes.
 * Therefore, placing such tiles on your map can be tricky because at runtime,
 * they are displayed elsewhere (except in the particular case where the
 * camera is in (0,0), the top-left corner of the map).
 * Note that collisions properties remain applied to the
 * real position of the tile and not to where they are displayed.
 * Usually, parallax scrolling is used for decoration only, for example to make
 * nice scrolling backgrounds.
