 *  \brief Macro to determine SDL version program was compiled against.
 *
 *  This macro fills in a SDL_version structure with the version of the
 *  library you compiled against. This is determined by what header the
 *  compiler uses. Note that if you dynamically linked the library, you might
 *  have a slightly newer or older version at runtime. That version can be
 *  determined with SDL_GetVersion(), which, unlike SDL_VERSION(),
 *  is not a macro.
 *
 *  \param x A pointer to a SDL_version struct to initialize.
 *
 *  \sa SDL_version
 *  \sa SDL_GetVersion
